# Improve Prompt

When the user asks to improve a prompt (or "make this prompt better", "refine the system prompt"):

1. **Locate** the prompt: check **app/prompts/** and any inline prompts in **app/chains/** or **app/agents/**.
2. **Apply** guidelines from **.cursor/rules/prompting.mdc**: clarity, structure (instructions vs context vs query), citation/grounding, and "I don't know" behavior.
3. **Propose** a concrete new version (or diff) with:
   - Clear role and task
   - Explicit output format
   - Placeholders for context and user query where applicable
   - One or two few-shot examples if the task is format-sensitive
4. **Suggest** where to store the updated prompt (same file in **app/prompts/** or a new template) and how to reference it in code.
5. Optionally suggest a small test or manual check to validate the improvement.
