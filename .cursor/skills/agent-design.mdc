# Agent Design Skill

## When to use

Use this skill when adding or changing agents: tool choice, reasoning loops, and orchestration with chains and retrieval.

## Knowledge

### Agent responsibilities

- **Orchestration**: Decide when to retrieve, call tools, or respond directly.
- **Tool use**: Call tools with correct arguments; handle errors and timeouts.
- **Context**: Combine user input, retrieved context, and tool results into a coherent response.

### Tools

- Define tools under **app/tools/** with clear names and descriptions for the LLM.
- Tools should be deterministic and side-effect-free where possible; document side effects (e.g. API calls).
- Validate inputs and return structured output or clear error messages.

### Chains

- Reusable sequences live in **app/chains/**; agents compose chains and tools.
- Prefer small chains that do one thing; combine in the agent layer.

### Prompts

- System prompts define agent behavior and tool-use instructions.
- Use **app/prompts/** for templates; see **prompting.mdc** for guidelines.

## Actions

- Add or modify agents in **app/agents/**; document in **agents.md**.
- Register new tools in **app/tools/** and expose them to the agent.
- Keep reasoning loops simple and testable; add tests under **tests/**.
