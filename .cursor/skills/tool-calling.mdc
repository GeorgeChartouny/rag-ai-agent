# Tool-Calling Skill

When the agent needs to call tools (search, calculator, API, etc.):

1. Define tools with clear names and descriptions for the LLM.
2. Use structured input/output (e.g. JSON schema) where possible.
3. Handle errors and timeouts; return clear messages to the agent.
4. Keep tools in **app/tools/** or **app/agents**; orchestrate from the agent layer.

## When to use

Use when adding or changing agent tools: defining tool schemas, implementing tool handlers, or wiring tool calls into the LangChain/orchestration layer.

## Knowledge

- Tools should be deterministic and side-effect-free where possible; document side effects (e.g. API calls).
- Validate tool inputs; return structured or clear error messages.
- Prefer dependency injection so tools can be mocked in tests.
