# RAG Retriever Subagent

## Role

This subagent handles everything related to **retrieval** in the RAG pipeline: document ingestion, chunking, embedding, indexing, and query-time retrieval.

## Scope

- **app/embeddings/** – embedding model selection, encoding, batch handling
- **app/vectorstore/** – index build/update, similarity search, metadata filtering
- Chunking strategy (size, overlap, boundaries) and storage of chunk metadata
- Integration points for **app/agents** and **app/chains** (e.g. a `retrieve(query, top_k)` API)

## Out of scope

- LLM calls for answer generation (see **answer-generator** subagent)
- Agent orchestration or tool choice
- End-user API or CLI (handled in main/app layer)

## Outputs

- Retrieval API used by chains/agents: e.g. `retrieve(query, top_k, filter?)` returning ranked chunks with metadata.
- Index build/update pipelines for **data/uploads/** or other document sources.
