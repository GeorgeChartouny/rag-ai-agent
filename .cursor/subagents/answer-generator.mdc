description: Subagent responsible for generating answers from context and user queries

# Answer Generator Subagent

## Role

This subagent handles **answer generation**: taking retrieved context and the user query, and producing a final answer via an LLM (and optionally tools).

## Scope

- **app/chains/** – chains that take (context, query) and produce an answer
- **app/prompts/** – answer-generation prompts (system + user template)
- Formatting, citations, and "I don't know" behavior when context is insufficient
- Optional tool use during generation (e.g. calculator, search) if defined in the agent

## Out of scope

- Retrieval implementation (see **rag-retriever** subagent)
- Low-level embedding or vector store code
- Document ingestion and chunking

## Outputs

- Chain(s) that accept retrieved context + query and return a structured or string response.
- Prompt templates and any post-processing (e.g. citation injection, length limits).
