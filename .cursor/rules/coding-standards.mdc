# Coding Standards

## Python

- Use **Python 3.10+**.
- Prefer type hints for public functions and class methods.
- Use a consistent formatter (e.g. Black) and linter (e.g. Ruff or flake8).
- Docstrings: use a consistent style (e.g. Google or NumPy) for modules, classes, and public functions.

## Structure

- One main responsibility per module; split large modules by domain or layer.
- Prefer small, testable functions; inject dependencies rather than importing singletons where it helps testing.
- Keep **app/** free of side effects at import time; initialize config and clients in a main or factory.

## Tests

- Tests live under **tests/**; mirror **app/** structure where useful.
- Use pytest; prefer fixtures for shared setup (e.g. in-memory vector store, mock LLM).
- Name test files `test_*.py` and test functions `test_*`.

## Imports

- Use absolute imports from the project root (e.g. `from app.tools import ...`).
- Avoid circular imports; use dependency injection or lazy imports if needed.
